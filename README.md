# GameOfLifeComposition
GameOfLifeComposition is a composition for SuperCollider generated using a GameOfLife cellular automata and two K3R1. 

## How it works
TheGameOfLife cellular automata (GoL) generates chords. The approach for generating the chords was inspired by CAMUS. For every chord a random basenote is chosen and the coordinates of the cell are interpreted as the intervals of the upper structure of the chord.
The K3R1 automats, for their part, control the chords duration and the panning position. This is done by defining a parameter value for every cell. The sequence is generated by creating a sequence of the 'alive' parameter values. Once all values are consumed, the next generation is generated. Again, only the 'alive' parameter values are considered for generating the sequence.

## Setup Guide
1. Find out the extension directory of your SuperCollider installation by running following command:
```
Platform.userExtensionDir
```
2. Copy `GameOfLife.sc` and `K2R1.sc` into this directory or create a link to the original file.  
3. Run `GameOfLifeComposition.sc` on SuperCollider. *Note: Don't forget to boot the server :wink:*
